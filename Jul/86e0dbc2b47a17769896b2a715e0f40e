Silvis, Illinois - American Steve Stricker will seek to defend his title when he returns to the TPC Deere Run for the $4,4-million USPGA John Deere Classic which begins on Thursday. The 2009 victory was the second of the year for Stricker as he earned his sixth career title. Since his three shot win over three players last year he has collected two more wins giving him eight in total. Friday's round was washed out by rain, forcing players to complete both the third and final rounds on Sunday. There are just three players ranked in the top 20 in the world and just seven in the top 50 competing at this year's John Deere. Most of the world's top players are either taking the week off to get ready for the British Open or are competing in the Scottish Open. Other prominent players include, KJ Choi, Tim Clark, Zach Johnson, Kenny Perry, Rickie Fowler and Bubba Watson. The 43-year-old Stricker is ranked fourth in the world. He has made the cut in all 11 tournaments he's played and has four top 10 finishes, including a win in the Northern Trust Open four months ago. "It's always exciting to come back to a place where you've had success," Stricker said. "Just driving in the gates and remembering some of the shots that happened down the stretch, the way the whole week played out last year, is always fun to look back at and reflect on a little bit. Coming off a couple of weeks off, I feel fresh and excited to play." Next up after the John Deere for the USPGA is the Reno-Tahoe Open where American John Rollins won by three shots in 2009. - Sapa-AFP
