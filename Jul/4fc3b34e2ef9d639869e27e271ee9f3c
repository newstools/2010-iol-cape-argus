Sydney - Australia dropped five players including winger Drew Mitchell on Wednesday and called up four newcomers in a major squad shake-up for this year's Tri-Nations. Coach Robbie Deans also axed Lachlan Turner and front-rowers Pek Cowan, Laurie Weeks and hooker Huia Edmonds in the revamp, after a rare home loss to England and a scrappy win over Ireland and with the World Cup looming next year. But utility back Kurtley Beale was retained, escaping further punishment after he was fined AUS$5 000 for urinating in public outside a Brisbane nightclub. Centre Anthony Faingaa, lock Rob Simmons and back-row forwards Scott Higginbotham and Ben McCalman were given the chance of a Test debut during the series with New Zealand and South Africa, which starts on Saturday. "Anthony and Ben... are both uncompromising players who are very direct, and showed playing for the Australian Barbarians that they have the ability to step up to the next level," said Deans. Front-rowers Benn Robinson and Stephen Moore return after missing the June Tests through injury, but hooker Tatafu Polota-Nau is awaiting ankle surgery and prop Ben Alexander and number eight Stephen Hoiles are both recovering from operations. Australia named only 28 players, leaving two squad places open as they assess form and ongoing injury concerns. The Wallabies' first game is against reigning champions South Africa in Brisbane on July 24. "We still have some decisions to make, and would like to see a little bit more club rugby before settling on the final two positions," said Deans.
